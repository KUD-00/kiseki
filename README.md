# Introduction
This is a blog to record my life using next.js and markdown, deployed on vercel.

I followed the steps in [THIS BLOG](https://reffect.co.jp/react/nextjs-markdown-blog#i-12) and created this site.

I will refine it in my way, to improve my web-development skill(PROGRAMMING IS SO HARD).
